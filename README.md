CyberSecurityChatbot is a simple console-based chatbot that provides cybersecurity awareness tips.
It features ASCII art, an interactive question-and-answer system, and an optional voice greeting.

Ensure you have .NET installed on your system. Place greeting.wav in the same directory as the executable or update its path in the code.
Compile using csc CyberSecurityChatbot.cs and run with CyberSecurityChatbot.exe.
The chatbot will greet you with ASCII art and a voice greeting if the file is present. 
It prompts you to enter your name, then allows you to ask questions related to password safety, phishing, and safe browsing.
Type "exit" to end the session. 
If an unrecognized query is entered, the bot will prompt for clarification.
